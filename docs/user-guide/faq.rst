What version of the Python Client should I use?
-----------------------------------------------

If you are starting a new project or your existing project does not yet use the
Python Client, we encourage you to use the **latest stable version** of the Python
Client.

----

If you are already using the Python Client, you have 3 options:


1. **"I like my project's code the way it is."**
  Keep using the version you are on.

2. **"I want some new features released in versions with the same major version that I'm currently using."**
  Upgrade to the latest stable version *with the same major version* as what
  you currently use.

3. **"I want all new features and I'm willing to modify my code to get those features!"**
  Upgrade to the latest stable version *even* if it has a different major
  version from what you currently use.
