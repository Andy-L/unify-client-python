Installation
============

Installation is as simple as::

  pip install tamr-unify-client

.. note::
  We recommend you use a virtual environment for your project and install the
  Python Client into that virtual environment.

  You can create a virtual environment with Python 3 via::

    python3 -m venv my-venv
