Bug Reports / Feature Requests

Please leave bug reports and feature requests as `Github issues <https://github.com/Datatamer/unify-client-python/issues>`_ .

Be sure to check through existing issues (open and closed) to confirm that the
bug hasnâ€™t been reported before.

Duplicate bug reports are a huge drain on the time of other contributors, and
should be avoided as much as possible.

Contributing
------------

For bug fixes, documentation changes, and small features:

  1. Fork it: https://github.com/[my-GitHub-username]/unify-client-python/fork
  2. Create your feature branch (``git checkout -b my-new-feature``)
  3. Commit your changes (``git commit -am 'Add some feature'``)
  4. Push to the branch (``git push origin my-new-feature``)
  5. Create a new Pull Request

For larger new features: Do everything as above, but first also make contact
with the project maintainers to be sure your change fits with the project
direction and you won't be wasting effort going in the wrong direction.
